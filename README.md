# `bb` - **Just a _little_ more than BusyBox**

## What is `elcolio/bb`?
This is a quasi-minimal BusyBox rootfs with some basic utilities added for flexible yet minimal Docker images. I say _quasi_-minimal because the goal is to support just enough shell utilities to enable effective scripting while keeping out as much cruft as possible. As a result this image clocks in at **18.57MB**, but comes with many of the utilities that keep the smaller, more basic [library BusyBox image](https://hub.docker.com/_/busybox/) from being quite as useful.

## Features
 - Uses Yelp's [dumb-init](https://github.com/Yelp/dumb-init) as the `ENTRYPOINT` to make sure PID1 is correctly managed
 - OpenSSL, OpenSSH, and root CA certificates pre-installed
 - `curl`, `wget`, and `jq` for API queries
 - [runit](http://smarden.org/runit/index.html) for handling multiple processes
   - The default `CMD` is `runsvdir /etc/service`, so any configured `runit` services start automatically
   - Specifying a `CMD` will skip `runit`
 - Several editors (`uemacs`, `vi`, `nano`) because I don't know which one you like
 - Based on `glibc`, so it can run non-statically linked Go binaries among other things (see the `musl`-based Alpine Linux for an even smaller base image with a package manager if `glibc` isn't important to you)

## Build + Customize
**To build:** To build the default image, run `make all`. You can build individual components with `make builder|rootfs|image`. To speed things up, you can use Docker v1.10's tmpfs mounts to store the buildroot directories (enable in `config/build.conf`). You'll need lots of RAM though, the tmpfs mount will need about 4GB depending on your selections.

Since this is Buildroot, the build will take approximately one eternity. I've taken to spinning up a fairly large DigitalOcean instance, mounting `/var/lib/docker` as tmpfs, running the build, and removing the instance. This will make the entire build run from a RAM disk, so I/O bottlenecks should be minimized. For example:

```bash
docker-machine create -d digitalocean --digitalocean-image ubuntu-15-10-x64 --digitalocean-size 16gb bb
docker-machine ssh bb "systemctl stop docker; mount -t tmpfs -o rw,size=10G,mode=700 tmpfs /var/lib/docker; systemctl start docker"
```

**To customize:** Put your custom Buildroot and BusyBox configs in the `config/` dir (replacing the existing ones). Modify `config/build.conf` to change the Buildroot version, tmpfs settings and resulting image names. For anything bigger please consider submitting a PR - sharing is caring.
